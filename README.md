# Thermal Image Object Detection

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the YOLOv8 model for object detection in thermal images. The goal is to evaluate the model's performance using a custom dataset and compare the results of a pre-trained model against a fine-tuned version.



## Introduction

Thermal imaging is widely used in various applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and industrial inspections. This project focuses on detecting objects in thermal images using the YOLOv8 model, showcasing its effectiveness in this domain.

## Implementation
For detailed implementation and evaluation, please refer to the thermal.ipynb notebook in this repository.
